# General Information

This implementation was written without dependencies except for the windows API and will not work on any os other than 64-bit Windows. The functions defined in lib.s all use the Windows 64-bit ABI. The implementation is not heavily optimized.

To build, run build.bat. It assumes GoLink as linker and nasm as assembler.
