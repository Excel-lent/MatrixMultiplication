# Guide for benchmarking of PHP

## Install pthreads
Please visit the [GitHub repo of pthreads](https://github.com/krakjoe/pthreads) to get the installable version for your os.

## Benchmarking
Please use the cli for benchmarking, cause the browser view would timeout on larger matrix sizes and the pthreads library only has cli support.
