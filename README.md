# MatrixMultiplication
Just a little playground, to test and try the benefits of Running Calculations on CPU or GPU with multiple threads.

TODO:
* Implement the basic algorithm in CUDA to run it on NVIDIA GPUs. (Processing....)
* Implement NVIDIAs matrix multiplication algortihm in CUDA.
* Implement Strassen matrix multiplication algorithm in Java.
* Compare Runtimes.
